        I’m a Software Engineer Intern at Apora and a Computer Software
        Engineering student at Grafisch Lyceum Rotterdam, expected to graduate
        in 2026.<br />
        I focus on front-end development and enjoy building clean, intuitive,
        and user-friendly interfaces. I have experience with JSX, JavaScript,
        HTML, Zoho CRM, and Zoho Creator, backed by a front-end development
        bootcamp. I love turning ideas into real, working products and I’m
        always excited to learn, improve, and collaborate with development
        teams.

          <p>
            During my internship from September 2025 to January 2026, I worked
            on updating and improving a company website. When I started, the
            site had several issues with responsiveness and overall performance.
            I went through each problem systematically, fixing layout
            inconsistencies, improving mobile compatibility, and optimizing user
            experience, ultimately making the website run smoothly and reliably.
            This project was built on Zoho Sites, a low-code platform hosted by
            Zoho, which gave me the opportunity to strengthen my skills in
            low-code development while solving real-world front-end challenges.

          <h2>TinDog</h2>
          <p>
            This is a website I built entirely using Bootstrap. My goal was to
            get hands-on practice with Bootstrap’s grid system, components, and
            utilities, while also having a bit of fun with the project. I
            experimented with layout design, responsive elements, and styling
            options to see how far I could push the framework. It was a great
            way to strengthen my front-end skills and learn how to build a fully
            functional, mobile-friendly website from scratch using just
            Bootstrap.
